"""
Uses of Python :
1) AI/ML.
2) Data Science.
3) Data Analysis.
4) Backend.
5) Software Development.

"""

# What is Difference Between Low-Level , High-Level , Mid-Level Languages ?

"""
1) Low Level Language : The Language which is easily understandable by the machine and hard by the humans. ex : binary Number.
2) Mid Level Language : The Language which is partially understandable by the machine and humans. ex : C sharp.
3) High Level Language : The Language easily understandable by the humans and hard by machines . ex : Python.
"""

# What is Dynamic Type Language ?

"""
The Language which decide the variable type at the run time.
ex :
    a=10 (int)
    a=10.5 (float)
"""

# What is Interpreted Language ?

"""
The Language which check line by line of code , stop at the error and give the output without checking whole code.
"""

# What is Scripting Language ?

"""
The Language which use the Interpreter as a Translator.
"""

# What is Object - Oriented Language ?

"""
The Language which supports oops principles , enabling modules , reusable , extensible code through concepts like classes , objects...etc

oops :
1) Class.
2) Object.
3) Inheritance.
4) Polymorphism.
5) Encapsulation.
6) Abstracton.
"""

# What is Platform Independent Language ?

"""
The Language which run on any operating system like macos , windows , linux ...etc
"""

# Support Multiple Programming Paradigms ?

"""
Support Multiple Programming Paradigms :
1)Oops (Object Oriented Programming)
2)Fop (Functional Object Oriented)
3)Pop (Procedual Object Oriented)
